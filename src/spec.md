# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Localize the game interface to Spanish for Spanish-speaking users.

**Planned changes:**
- Translate all user-facing text in the game interface to Spanish (game title, buttons, score labels, timer, high score, game over messages)
- Update HTML page title and meta tags to Spanish

**User-visible outcome:** The entire game interface displays in Spanish, allowing Spanish-speaking users to play the game in their native language.
